Dameon D. Welch-Abernathy, widely known as “PhoneBoy”, is a Security
Architect for [Check Point Software Technologies][1] where he reviews
customer security architecture, deployment, design, and related processes
to identify security gaps and define strategies for improving security
posture and lower operational costs. 

A recognized industry security veteran, with two decades of experience,
Welch-Abernathy is best known for his creation of the *PhoneBoy FireWall-1
FAQ* in the mid-1990s. It was used by Check Point and thousands of its
customers worldwide. He is also the author of *Essential Check Point
FireWall-1 NG: An Installation, Configuration, and Troubleshooting Guide*.
A well-known author in the blog sphere, he is a trusted security authority.  

Welch-Abernathy holds a B.S. in Computer Science from Santa Clara
University and is a current Certified Information Systems Security
Professional (CISSP).

**Where Did The Name PhoneBoy Come From?**
The name PhoneBoy was given to Welch-Abernathy by one of the hosts of
[Radionet Talk Radio][11], a radio show he used to work on in 1996 as a
call screener. The host forgot his name one day and called him the phone
boy just to call him something.

“[The host] is never going to let this name go,” Welch-Abernathy thought,
“so I might as well embrace it.” 

phoneboy.com was registered and the rest was history.
