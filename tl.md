# Security Consolidation

## Issues

* Number of tools required to "secure" organization.
    * For some organizations, this numbers into hundreds
* Amount of manpower needed to manage all tools
    * Need people to monitor/operate tools
    * Training for existing staff and/or hire specialists
* Cost of all the tools
    * Acquisition cost
    * Deployment cost
    * Annual maintenance cost
    * Training cost
* Integration/correlation of information between security tools
    * Consistency enforcement of policy between tools
    * Consistency of information provided by tools (logs)
    * Correlation of logs across security tools (SIEM)
* Management Consolidation vs Function Consolidation
    * More security functionality managed from fewer places
* Increased use of Cloud Infrastructure 
    * Can be Private Cloud or Public Cloud
    * Rapid rate of change requires different deployment model for security
    * Automation required to retain cloud efficiency and reduce human error

## Solutions

* Review entire architecture to look for protection gaps
* Where possible extend existing tools to cover protection gaps
* Manage more security functions from fewer management consoles
    * Vendor consolidation does not necessarily equal management 

consolidation
* Consolidate security functions where appropriate to: 
    * Increase consistency of enforcement throughout environment
    * Lower acquisition costs for suite versus "best of breed"
    * Lower operational effort/cost to maintain security infrastructure
    * Reduce need to be cross-trained on security tools
* Automate and Orchestrate
    * Management should be scriptable/automatable using Open APIs
    * Information from cloud environments should integrate into physical 

enforcement modules

# Cloud

## Issues

* Infrastructure is virtualizing
    * Private versus Public Cloud
* Decrease in visibility
* Increase in agility required 
* Increased complexity, particularly when managed manually
* P
    * In Public Cloud or IaaS, enforcement with physical controls isn't 

possible

## Solutions

* Security 

# Mobile

## Issues

* Users don't want security on their devices

## Solutions

* Protect the data on the device
