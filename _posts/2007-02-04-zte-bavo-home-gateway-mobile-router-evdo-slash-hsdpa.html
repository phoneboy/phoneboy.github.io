<p>Ran across <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rfwel.com/shop/product.php?productid=603&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1">this</a>. Oh <em>man</em> this looks like an interesting device.</p>

<p>This could prove to be quite an interesting device. It is a little out of my price range, but it <em>does</em> combine several useful features into a tiny little box, which makes it worth considering.</p>
