<p>From <a href="http://phoneboy.com/ps/305" title="Link: http://phoneboy.com/ps/305">PhoneBoy Speaks Ep 305: Threat? What Threat?</a></p></p>
<blockquote><p>In sealed court documents accidentally leaked on a US Federal government website, the US government basically admits that there has been no attempted domestic hijackings of any kind in the 12 years since 9/11. Furthermore, at least as of mid-2011, terrorist threat groups present in the Homeland are not known to be actively plotting against civil aviation targets or airports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It gets better. <a href="http://tsaoutofourpants.wordpress.com" title="Link: http://tsaoutofourpants.wordpress.com">Jonathan Corbett</a>, the guy who has been challenging the feds on the constitutionality and the effectiveness of the TSA in the courts, <a href="http://tsaoutofourpants.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/censored-department-of-justice-demands-that-i-stop-talking-about-leaked-document/" target="_blank" title="Link: http://tsaoutofourpants.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/censored-department-of-justice-demands-that-i-stop-talking-about-leaked-document/">was told by the US Justice Department to take down his comments</a> about a sealed document he wasn't allowed to talk about, but the government themselves posted the unredacted version on their site and other sites made it public.</p>
<p>The same is true for Corbett's comments about those documents, the Justice Department asked him to remove from his site, but they apparently forgot to tell Google as it was still in their cache!</p>
<p>This is a clear demonstration of what can happen if confidential data inadvertently leaves your organization. Clearly this unredacted, sealed legal brief should have never been made public. Thankfully, in this case, it was, but surely some folks in the US Government weren't happy with this lapse. Neither would your employer if it's your company's secret plans for world domination that got leaked.</p>
<p>Likewise, if you inadvertently leak information on your own website, or someone else does, even if you can manage to get it taken down, Google takes a while to forget it saw it. The rest of the Internet won't necessarily forget, though. Ever.</p>
<p>So what are your plans for Data Loss Prevention in your organization? Are you even employing any DLP technology? Is it actually catching real incidents of data loss or is everyone going around it? </p>
<p>I'm not saying DLP is a panacea or 100% effective, but if you're not doing it, then you don't have any idea where your corporate information might end up. </p>
