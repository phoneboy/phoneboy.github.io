<p><a target="_blank" href="http://wp.me/p2VU6D-1eW">On today's episode of PhoneBoy Speaks</a>, I discuss how to prevent your Twitter account from being <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-burger-king-twitter-hack-0219-20130218,0,477071.story">hacked like Burger King's account was</a>. And today (after I recorded this episode), <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2013/02/19/jeep_twitter_account_hacked_on_tuesday_one_day_after_buger_king_s_was.html" title="Link: http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2013/02/19/jeep_twitter_account_hacked_on_tuesday_one_day_after_buger_king_s_was.html">Jeep's Twitter account was also hacked</a>. Of course, I can only do so much in a 5 minute podcast, and the topic itself of choosing strong passwords--and getting users to actually do it--has been covered ad-infinitum elsewhere.</p>
<p>The fact is, passwords are not very secure. To be secure, they must be both long (number of characters) and high-entropy (more random, the better). Humans, as a lot, are not able to remember passwords that meet both of these requirements, so they cheat. They either write the passwords down, they use password management tools like LastPass or 1Password, or they just choose stupid passwords--usually the latter.</p>
<p>The best compromise I've seen is actually the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.grc.com/haystack.htm">Password Haystacks</a> method that Steve Gibson came up with. All other things being equal, as long as you use all 4 different types of characters in your password, length wins. Because when it comes to guessing passwords, there is no such thing as "close."</p>
<p>Of course, if the password itself can't be guessed, surely you can compromise the password reset process, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/all/">as was done with Mat Honan's widely publicized pwnage</a>. Hopefully we can strengthen that too, but companies--especially ones that cater to non technical people--rarely err on the side of secure.</p>
