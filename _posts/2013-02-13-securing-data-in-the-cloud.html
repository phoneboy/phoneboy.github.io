<p>On my podcast PhoneBoy Speaks today, I discussed (very briefly) the idea of <a target="_blank" href="http://wp.me/p2VU6D-1ey" title="Link: http://wp.me/p2VU6D-1ey">doing information security in the cloud</a>. Surely, I could talk and write volumes on the subject. I've even given presentations on the subject.</p>
<p>The reality is, virtualization changes the game in so many ways that it's hard to know where to begin. That said, my view starts with the most basic question: what is it we're ultimately trying to protect?</p>
<p>The good news is that the answer is still the same, regardless of whether physical servers on your premises are involved or some cloud services provider is: it's the data. Your job in information security is to ensure the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of data to prevent Disclosure, Alteration, or Destruction of said data.  </p>
<p>The bad news: the cloud makes this job a lot harder. The reality of bring your own device (BYOD) also makes this harder for much the same reason--less opportunities to inject the necessary controls to ensure data doesn't go where it's not supposed to.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not just about protecting the data. That part is actually pretty easy. Protecting in a way that allows it to be used in a convenient way, now that's a lot harder.</p>
