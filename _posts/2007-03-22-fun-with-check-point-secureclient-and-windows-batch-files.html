<p>In my past life, I did a heck of a lot with Check Point FireWall-1, now called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.checkpoint.com/products/perimeter.html">VPN-1 Power</a> or something. I don't do much with it now except for use their VPN client to access work, but I do spend some of my day job reviewing stuff <em>other people </em>write about it.</p>
<p>One of the things I have to do in order to use my work computer on my home network is to actually allow my work computer to access a couple of things at home: namely my Mac sitting right next to it and my network printer. Unfortunately, the combination of the VPN configuration and the firewall software loaded on the laptop make this a challenge, but not difficult.</p>
<p>One of the things the VPN does is add all these routes to the routing table that essentially <em>override </em>the local routes. Now I can see why an enterprise might want to do that, but if you want to access local resources, then it creates a challenge.</p>
<p>What I was doing to correct this issue was doing all this by hand: looking at the routing table, removing the offending routes, and adding a few others. In smaller environments, the routes are going to always be to the same default IP. The problem with the implementation I am working with is the nexthop for these routes has a habit of being different each time I connect. I needed to look at the routing table manually before doing the surgery on it. The end result was that I could access the machines I needed.</p>
<p>Today, I got the bug to automate all this, so I decided to write a Windows Batch file to accomplish all this. Apparently, this was harder than I thought, but I wrote a batch file that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Looked at the routing table for a route I know the VPN will set. Fortunately Windows allows you to print only a specific route.</li>
<li>Parse out all the junk that gets printed in addition to the information I wanted. This parsing turned out to be the most difficult, particularly in getting the information <em>out</em> of a FOR loop.</li>
<li>Set routes, which is relatively easy once you have the information.</li>
</ul>
<p>And <a target="_blank" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ftw">FTW</a>, I decided to also add in automatically logging into SecureClient. One batch script logs me in and mucks with the routing table. To find <em>that</em> information, I had to refer to a tome I wrote <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FEssential-Check-Point-FireWall-1-Troubleshooting%2Fdp%2F0321180615%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1174637500%26sr%3D8-5&amp;tag=phoneboycom-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">nearly four years ago</a><img width="1" alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ir?t=phoneboycom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" height="1" />. Yes, I know it was published in 2004, but I did a lot of the writing for it in 2002/2003. Damn publisher lead times. Anyway, I looked in a more recent Check Point book (on NGX) that I had lying around and it didn't even cover SecureClient on the command line. It's not the first time I found something in my own book that hasn't made it into other, more recent books, either.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am happy to say it's all working just fine. I do miss being able to use my SecureClient GUI (enabling CLI mode disables all that stuff), but I like how much easier the entire logging on experience is now. For those who are interested, I am posting my batch job after the break. If you're interested, click on thru and read my handy work.</p>
