I was listening to the end of [DtSR Episode 179](http://podcast.wh1t3rabbit.net/dtsr-episode-179-newscast-for-feb-2nd-2016) when a question was asked: would you (or someone you know) buy a "secure" router that cost $25 more? That wasn't the exact question, but that was the gist.

The immediate question I thought in response was the following (which, of course, I tweeted with the #dtsr hashtag): "How much (more) security do you get for $25? How much (more) do you get for $250,000? And how can non-infosec folks evaluate that?"

The challenge, of course, is how do you quantify security and the value that security provides. There is definitely no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. It comes down to quantifying the various risk in monetary terms. You know, in terms of [single-loss expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-loss_expectancy) or [annualized loss expectancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annualized_loss_expectancy). 

This assumes you know what assets you're protecting, have some understanding about the value of those assets, and have some clue about the likelihood of a loss and what impact that might have to the asset's value. Many organizatons I've talked to can't articulate these things, and that's a problem. You have no idea how much you *should* spend to protect those assets. You don't want to spend $1000 to protect a $10 asset, but you might spend $10 to protect a $1000 asset. 

And if you think information security professionals have a tough time figuring this stuff out, think about how everyone else approaches the same situation. Is there any wonder there is so much [FUD in information security marketing](/2016/01/31/fud-and-cybersecurity-marketing/)?
