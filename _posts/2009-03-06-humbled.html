<p>One of the things that is making this transition to Check Point Software easier is the community of people that support, use, and sell what used to be called Firewall-1, but now goes by a few different names and offers many more functions than just firewalling and VPNs. It's a community I have never really left, having spent the last decade in Nokia's Security Appliance Business, but it's one I was less visible in over the past several years.</p>
<p>Despite being less visible in recent years, I have still been contributing, albeit indirectly. I have been maintaining Nokia's knowledge base, which of course contains many articles that relate to Check Point. I haven't written many Check Point-related articles in recent years, but I do work to make sure that the articles other folks in support write are readable. I also help our team out in various, sundry capacities, with the goal being to get customer issues resolved quickly.</p>
<p>In the course of this work, and my presence on many a social network, I run across the occasional person who thanks me for the contribution I made to the betterment of the Check Point community many years ago. As I re-engage in the community, the accolades have noticeably increased.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kellman Meghu, a SE manager for Check Point Software in Canada, recently gave a troubleshooting presentation for CPX 2009 in Las Vegas (CPX, or Check Point Experience, is their annual trade show). In the presentation, he apparently decided to use a picture of me to represent when things got hairy and you needed expert advice from support.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/kellman/status/1286590746">Kellman tweeted the following yesterday</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Used a picture of @<a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/PhoneBoy">PhoneBoy</a> in his presentation. The crowd cheered; no one has forgotten the help he has provided to CP users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To say I was touched and humbled is an understatement.</p>
<p>So what now? Hard to make any grand plans under the circumstances, but I'm keeping busy. I'm still running the <a target="_blank" href="http://fw1-gurus.phoneboy.com/" title="Link: http://fw1-gurus.phoneboy.com/">FireWall-1 Gurus</a> mailing list and participating on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cpug.org/">CPUG Forums</a>, helping out where I can. It's not much, but until the deal between Nokia and Check Point closes, it's difficult to do much else.</p>
