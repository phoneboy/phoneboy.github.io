<p>I decided to move PhoneBoy's Security Theater off of Wordpress onto <a href="http://posthaven.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Link: http://posthaven.com">Posthaven</a>. </p>
<p>On the plus side, it's one less instance of Wordpress to maintain. On the minus side, I had to copy/paste the old articles in since there is no way to import Wordpress as of yet. But it was under 100 articles and it was kind of nice to see my thoughts on security from the last several years again.</p>
<p>The reality is, the threats haven't changed. We've had to evolve the tools in order to address increasingly complex threats. You can look at Check Point's own product evolution to get a sense of that.</p>
<p>Also, the basics haven't changed. A lot of security risks can be sufficiently mitigated by properly segmenting your networks, using sufficiently complex passwords that are unique, proper monitoring of the logs of your security devices, and keeping your software up-to-date with the latest security patches. </p>
