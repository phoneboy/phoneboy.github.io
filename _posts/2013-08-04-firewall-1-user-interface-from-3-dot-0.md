If you ran Check Point FireWall-1 on SunOS or Solaris, you probably remember this screen:

<center><img class="posthaven-gallery-image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/medium_fwui30.png" /></center>

This is a screen capture from fwui, the management interface for FireWall-1. Actually FireWall-1 2.0 and 2.1 looked like this too.

Meanwhile if you ran the management interface on Windows, you were presented with something like this:

<center><img class="posthaven-gallery-image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/fw1.gif" /></center>

You could actually run the firewall on Windows NT as of 2.1, though it took until 2.1c until it was reasonably stable.

Actually you could run something that looked like the Windows UI on Solaris with Motif, which Check Point charged extra for. Eventually the Motif and the OpenLook GUI were deprecated and what we now refer to as SmartDashboad only runs on Windows.

And, of course, there are far more GUI clients these days--about a dozen or so if I remember correctly. But then again, the product does so much more today than it did back in the mid 1990s.

And yes, I remember those days quiet fondly.
