<p>Here is the email from (ISC)2:</p>
<blockquote><p>Candidate Id: xxxxxx</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is to advise you that your documents have been processed in the system as of today.</p>
<p>We are now printing certificates every day, therefore your certificate should be printed within a day following processing.</p>
<p>Your package will be mailed out within a couple days after the certificate is printed. Stateside delivery usually takes 10 days to 2 weeks; overseas delivery is 4-6 weeks.</p>
<p>Your official designation date will be the date your certificate is printed. You may NOT use the designation until your certificate is printed.</p>
<p>If you do not receive your package within your specified time frame, please contact [address deleted] as she handles the certificate printing and mailings.</p>
