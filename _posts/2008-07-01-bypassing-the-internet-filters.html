<p>In the evenings, I like to work downstairs on one of the kids computers. It's nice to sit somewhere else and work. Keeps the mind fresh, and it also allows me to experiment a bit.</p>
<p>One problem with doing this is the web filters, which I've set up to prevent "accidental" exposure to the naughtiness of the Internet. I'm usingÂ <a target="_blank" href="http://www.k9webprotection.com/">K9WebProtection</a>, which is a free Windows-based filter that only filters access via the web browser. It does not filter other programs.</p>
<p>The problem is, I have the settings set fairly stringent. The default setting blocks access to Flickr, YouTube, Share on Ovi, and others. Things I tend to look at while I'm blogging. Whitelisting those sites is possible, but not happening. Having to type in my password every 15 minutes is just annoying.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon a solution this evening with some Googling. It completely and utterly bypasses K9WebProtection and could easily be done by someone without user privileges.</p>
<p>How did I do it? I'm not going to say. For obvious reasons. However, search the Oracle of Google and you'll find the answer. However, at least now I can do my work without disabling the Internet filter.</p>
