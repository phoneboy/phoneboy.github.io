<p>As a guy who has made a living in the network security business, and is really unhappy with the state of security on the Internet, I like to see <em>proper </em>security in the hands of real people.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/securitykey">PayPal Security Key</a> is exactly that. This key adds a second factor to the authentication process for your PayPal account. Instead of just relying on a fixed password to log into your PayPal account, you append a constantly changing passcode to it provided by the PayPal Security Key.</p>
<p>The PayPal Security Key is actually an RSA SecurID token. SecurID tokens are used by corporations everywhere to provide strong authentication to end users. I have to use my SecurID token a couple of times a day to keep my VPN connection to the office alive.</p>
<p>SecurID uses a hardware token with a value that changes every minute or so. The card is synchronized with a server, which validates the authentication attempt. So long as you do not lose this card, your authentication will be secure.</p>
<p>SecurID tokens come in a number of different shapes and sizes. The PayPal Security Key actually fits on your keyring. The one I use for work is about the shape of a credit card. It also contains a keypad on which I enter my own PIN, which hashes the PIN to a different value. The great thing is that the people that maintain the SecurID server don't even need to know my PIN. It just works. ;)</p>
