<p>On the two Check Point user community sites <a target="_blank" href="http://cpug.org/forums">CPUG</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cpshared.com/forums">CPshared</a>, I made a couple of interesting observations today:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPshared already had more active threads today than CPUG. This includes all the public boards, which I verified by loading up both sites in Google Chrome's "Incognito Mode" to ensure I wasn't logged in.</li>
<li>The number of Check Point employees already participating on CPshared is far more than I've ever noticed on CPUG in the past two years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep in mind that the CPUG forums have been around since August 2005. CPshared was only "officially" announced last week--it had been privately tested for about 4 weeks before that.</p>
<p>Again, these are just observations. They may be completely meaningless. You can come to your own conclusions here.</p>
