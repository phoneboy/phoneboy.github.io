Many of you probably remember the Check Point FireWall-1 FAQ I ran for many years. Many have told me it was their “go-to” source of information on all things Check Point, well before Check Point had SecureKnowledge.

Well, I’m here to say: it’s back…in a manner of speaking.

More specifically, I am back doing the activity I was doing twenty years ago, namely trying to help the Check Point community make the best use of the stuff they bought and make the resulting information available to everyone. 

The one difference? I’m doing it for Check Point now, as opposed to doing it
as an independent effort. The name of the site? [CheckMates](https://community.checkpoint.com)–and no, it's not a dating site.

This site was previously called Exchange Point and was launched around the
time R80 was released a little over a year ago. Previously the site was just
focused on management, but it has been expanded to cover all of the products
that make up Check Point Infinity.

Even in the past, I personally didn't have all the answers. The one thing I
did do was make what I did know and what others contributed available to all.
I had plenty of help from people in the community back then, including from
people at Check Point. 

In that regard, nothing’s changed. CheckMates will be a collaborative effort.
Unlike in the past, Check Point's role will be more prominent, especially
since they are hosting the site and paying my salary.

At the end of the day, I want CheckMates to be like phoneboy.com was back in
the day: to be the go-to resource for all things Check Point. It's a tall
order, and I know what's there is not much now, but phoneboy.com wasn’t
much back when I started, either.

To give you a small sample of the discussions on CheckMates, I've put together
[a small sample](https://community.checkpoint.com/blogs/about-checkmates/2017/07/14/this-week-in-checkmates-week-of-10th-july-2017) of some of the
threads that happened last week.
