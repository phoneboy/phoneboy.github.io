For various reasons I decided to move the hosting of this blog to
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.io). This also meant changing the
backend to Jekyll, which I already use for phoneboy.com anyway, but I
use a different hosting arrangement there. I now have a nice, spiffy
new site theme as well. Not that too many people care about that
stuff.

I've also realize in the various moves the RSS feed changed a couple
of times. For those of you still using RSS feeds, it's now:
