A year ago, I had written a post about competition in the information
security space, of which I work as a part of for a vendor that has been
in it for nearly a quarter century: Check Point Software Technologies. A
few things have changed since I wrote the post and I decided, rather than
merely repost my previous post, create a new version of it and update with
some relevant information. I've removed the old post because it largely
says the same thing.

## Why I'm In This Industry

The devices, networks, and social institutions we use today are only
useful because, on the whole, most people largely trust them. If this trust
erodes, people will not make use of them.

It took me many years of working at Nokia to realize that regardless of what
I do in life, I am always going to be looking for where the flaws are in
the systems and do what I can to improve these systems so they will
remain trusted.

As a company, Check Point firmly believes customers deserve the best security
for their digital information. That, plus my long-time history with Check Point
was why I ultimately decided to go work for Check Point when they acquired
Nokia's Security Appliance Business back in 2009. The talented, smart people
I work with day-in and day-out working toward the same goal is why I'm still
here, even though some have left for what they see as greener pastures, or
at the very least, a diferent pasture.

## What About The Competition

One of the things I've always tried to do online is to bring facts,
understanding, and details to light. This is what I did with the FireWall-1
FAQ back and the day and what I'm trying to do as part of my effort with
Check Point's user community: [CheckMates](https://community.checkpoint.com).

You may have noticed that I occasionally delve into the subject of Check
Point's competition in my online discourse. The main reason I do this is
because some of them are saying stuff that flat out isn't true, a gross
misrepesentation, or they advocate a poor approach.

To be clear, I think healthy competition is a good thing. It raises all
boats, regardless of who you ultimately use. Despite our differences in
approach, there is a common enemy: the malicious actors who attempt to
penetrate and disrupt our customers networks. We would do better as an
industry to remember that and work better together toward defeating
that common enemy.

Despite that common goal, everyone who works for a security vendor,
particularly in a sales or marketing capacity, wants to succeed over
the competition. As part of that, each vendor puts outs information
that puts their offering in the best light. Certainly Check Point has
done this with some past marketing campaigns such as:

* [Facts vs. Hype](https://www.checkpoint.com/resources/cybersecurity-threats-fact-vs-hype/)
* [50 Shades of PAN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p5rQucaqns)

This is all part of normal, healthy competition that happens in any industry.

Palo Alto Networks is clearly a different competitor and seems to play
by different rules, particularly with respect to Check Point.

## It's Personal for Palo Alto Networks

Nir Zuk, the co-founder of Palo Alto Networks, drives a car with the
license plate CHKPKLR. [This was widely known since at least 2005](https://www.sequoiacap.com/israel/company-story/palo-alto-networks-story/) and a picture
of said license plate was featured prominently at their 2016 Sales Kick Off:

The guy up on stage? Their CEO Mark McLaughlin, propagating the "Check
Point Killer" message to the assembled masses. 

Over the years, I've heard countless stories of how Nir Zuk would come in
to talk to a (potential) customer and spend a significant amount of time
talking about Check Point, to the point where he was thrown out of at
least one customer meeting! Given how some customers feel about Check Point,
I'm sure that tactic did help to drive some sales.

In the following picture, you can see Palo Alto Networks Chief Marketing
Officer Rene Bonvanie with a slide behind him of Check Point CEO
Gil Shwed:

To take it one step further, it was recently discovered that Palo
Alto Networks has a so-called "Check Point Kill Squad." This was disclosed
by way of a screenshot of what appeared to be an internal portal from
Palo Alto Networks. There was no real information in this screenshot, just
partial bullet points of a few competitive talking points against
Check Point SandBlast and the fact they also have a Competitive team--nothing
that wasn't already widely known or easily to deduce. 

Rather than simply ignore it, Palo Alto Networks saw fit to issue a DMCA
takedown notice, causing [Moti Sagey's LinkedIn account to be temporarily suspended](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6334640002059894784).
Given their propensity to use [EULAs as a way to prevent the truth from being disclosed about their products](http://phoneboy.org/2014/11/20/what-is-palo-alto-networks-afraid-of/), using a DMCA takedown to needle someone at a competitor
doesn't seem too far fetched. 

## Conclusion

It's clear the hatred of Check Point is institutionalized at Palo Alto
Networks and that it comes straight from the top. Given they [still haven't
fixed potential bypasses in their product two years after they were reported](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThczL7U2It4), it makes me question what
business they are truly in.

**Disclaimer**: My blog, my personal opinions. I'm sure you knew that.
