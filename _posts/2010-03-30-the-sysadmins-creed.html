<p>A poem that needs no explanation to those who understand it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is my network. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My network is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I master my life. My network, without me, is useless. Without my network, I am useless. I must send my packets true. I must block packets faster than my enemy who is trying to pwn me. I must pwn him before he pwns me. I will....</p>
<p>My network is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weakness, its strength, its clients, its servers, its switches, its routers and firewalls. I will keep my network clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...</p>
<p>Before God I swear this creed. My network and myself are the defenders of the world. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of our data. So be it, until there is no enemy, but Peace.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
