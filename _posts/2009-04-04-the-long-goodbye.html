<p>Over my 10 years in Nokia's Security Appliance Business, I have met a lot of people. Many of these people worked in the business and moved onto other areas of Nokia. Others were the direct result of my "poking around." At one point, I hoped that I could leverage some of these contacts to branch out into other areas of Nokia.</p>
<p>Then, a funny thing happened at the end of September 2008. Nokia announced they were selling the Security Appliance Business to an outside investor. We were to become a new, independent company. Shortly thereafter, the wheels fell off the economy and the credit market dried up. This made such a venture untenable.</p>
<p>Shortly before Christmas, Nokia announced we were being sold to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software </a>. It wasn't the original plan, but under the circumstances, it made the most sense.</p>
<p>Despite the uncertain economic climate, not to mention the uncertain future all of us faced, a funny thing happened. We all pulled together, tightened our belts a little, and forged ahead. Profitability continued. Epic amounts of customer satisfaction were attained. We showed incredible strength and determination. Every one of us.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rest of Nokia downsized and reorganized. The company is asked employees to volunteer for a layoff as well as ideas for cost savings. I would not be surprised if additional actions are being considered to ensure survival during this protracted recession.</p>
<p>Clearly, my days at Nokia are numbered. Some of us will end up at Check Point. Others, sadly will not. It's not only a long goodbye to a company that has treated me well for 10+ years, but to a "family" of people I've worked with. While like all families, we disagreed at times, we all tried our best to "delight our customers" and be "very human" (to borrow a couple of Nokia's values).</p>
<p>While it is goodbye to some, many of us will continue to work together as part of Check Point. Clearly, it won't be the same as it was. I have hope that, in time, it will be much better than what we had.</p>
