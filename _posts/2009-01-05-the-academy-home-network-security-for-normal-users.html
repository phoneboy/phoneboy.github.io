<p>At one time, I thought about doing my own site for "home user" network security. Nice to see my buddies over at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theacademy.ca/">The Academy</a> doing it with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theacademyhome.com/">The Academy Home</a>. While the site is relatively new, they do have a few how-to videos available already, including installing a program I recommend wholeheartedly: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.k9webprotection.com/" title="Link: http://www.k9webprotection.com/">K9 Web Protection</a> from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bluecoat.com/">Blue Coat Systems</a>.</p>
<p>I'd like to see some stuff on configuring Windows XP with non-admin users for your kids. I have to do this for my friends all the time. That right there makes it more difficult for a piece of malware that does get in to do any damage.</p>
