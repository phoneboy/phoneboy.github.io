<p>From <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.zonealarm.com/2011/04/zonealarms-newest-security-solution-socialguard.html">ZoneAlarm’s Newest Security Solution: SocialGuard</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.zonealarm.com/security/en-us/zonealarm-socialguard-facebook-parental-control.htm" title="Link: http://www.zonealarm.com/security/en-us/zonealarm-socialguard-facebook-parental-control.htm">SocialGuard</a>, ZoneAlarm’s newest security solution, promises a groundbreaking new method of monitoring and preventing safety breaches on Facebook the most popular social networking site by a mile, with over 500 million users without “friending” your child and intruding on his/her social space. SocialGuard sends real-time alerts to parents via email–or the SocialGuard interface–whenever suspicious activity is detected on your child’s profile; parents can customize security settings and keywords to trigger such messages if the child is exposed to illicit or inappropriate content. SocialGuard monitors children’s Facebook accounts for threats including cyberbullying, age fraud ensures children are not befriended by adults outside of their network; friend requests, hacked accounts, and link safety flags dangerous/offensive links contained in messages.</p>
<p>The product, available now, can be purchased <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zonealarm.com/security/en-us/zonealarm-socialguard-facebook-parental-control.htm">here</a>.</p>

<p>Check Point, my employer, is behind this. I've used the betas of this product and they do precisely what they say without being a huge burden on you or your computer. The price: $1.99 a month or $19.99 a year, makes this a no-brainer if you have kids using Facebook!</p>
