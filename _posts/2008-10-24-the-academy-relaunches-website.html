<p>Several current and former <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nokia.com/" title="Link: http://www.nokia.com/">Nokia</a> colleagues are involved in a project called <a href="http://www.theacademy.ca" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Academy</a> where a number of videos are posted related to configuring security appliactions. The website has been relaunched and it's shaping up to be a great resource for the security geeks out there. Now, where's some videos on Sourcefire, Peter? :)</p>
