<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.crossbeam.com/crossbeam-and-check-point-expand-strategic-partnership/">Crossbeam has issued a press release</a> about their expanded strategic partnership with my employer, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Software Technologies</a>. The key paragraph in that press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>Customers can now purchase integrated solutions from Check Point, complete with maintenance and support delivered by Check Point’s award-winning global service organization. Check Point will provide support for both its software products and Crossbeam’s X-Series platform. This simplifies the ordering process and promotes closer product, sales and technical collaboration between Crossbeam and Check Point to support customer needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The kind of customers that will buy Crossbeam X-Series platforms are the kinds of customers who want what we used to call "first call, final resolution" back at Nokia. This is exactly what this provides: a single point of contact for purchasing and support of Check Point software on Crossbeam hardware. What's not to like?</p>
