<p>While I don't typically read End User License Agreements, I was pointed to the following phrase that exists in the <a href="https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/content/dam/paloaltonetworks-com/en_US/assets/pdf/datasheets/support/EULA-PANW-END-USER-LICENSE-AGREEMENT.pdf" target="_blank">End User License Agreement for Palo Alto Networks equipment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>1.3 License Restrictions: End user shall maintain Products in strict
confidence and shall not: [...] (d) disclose, publish or otherwise make
publicly available any benchmark, performance or comparison tests that End User
runs (or has run on its behalf by a third party) on the Products;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I trust you can think through the implications of this restriction on your own. It certainly adds additional color to the recent <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151219064633/https://www.nsslabs.com/blog/seriously/" target="_blank">public spat between NSS and Palo Alto Networks</a>.</p>
