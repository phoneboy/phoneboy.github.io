<p>For those of you who never had to work with Check Point FireWall-1 4.1 and earlier, you're lucky you likely never EVER had to use putkeys.</p>
<p>The fw putkey was used to establish authentication between the Management and Firewall modules. The problem was: the authentication would frequently break. Especially in larger, distributed environments. Often for reasons that no one outside of a few developers in Tel Aviv never fully understood.</p>
<p>The eventual replacement for fw putkey was SIC, which was added in FireWall-1 NG (5.0). It is based on certificates and is way easier to set up. It's also far less prone to random breakage. </p>
<p>The following classic article is presented for nostalgia purposes only. Hopefully no one in their right mind still needs this article, which was very popular on my FireWall-1 FAQ back in the day. It was the collective wisdom of my peers and my own experience as of around 2000 or so.</p>
<p><span id="more"></span></p>
<h1> Can't Get Putkeys to Work</h1>
<h2> Q:</h2>
<p> I can't get my putkeys to work ir I can't keep them working. What am I<br />
 doing<br />
wrong?</p>
<h2> A:</h2>
<p> One thing that I've always done on habit with my firewall systems is to</p>
<p>make sure all IPs on both the management and firewall are resolvable to<br />
 a<br />
hostname within the system's local host file and that the systems are<br />
 configured<br />
to look at the local hosts file before looking to DNS. As a<br />
 result, the<br />
number of issues I personally have had with putkeys in any<br />
 systems I have<br />
personally set up have been minimal. I would suggest doing<br />
 this before redoing<br />
all your putkeys. Also, double-check to make sure the time on your management<br />
console and firewall module have their time synchronized (relative to GMT).</p>
<p>One known issue: If you are using skey authentication on versions of<br />
 FireWall-1<br />
prior to 4.0 SP5, there is an issue whereby the authentication<br />
 can get out<br />
of sync. Either use fwn1 (which works on systems 4.0 SP4 and<br />
 earlier) or<br />
use none authentication. For more information, see: <a target="_blank">Failed</p>
<p>to Install Security Policy on fw62bs01: Unauthorized action.</a></p>
<p>If you have to redo your putkeys, there are three methods one can use</p>
<p>to do putkeys, one of which usually works:
 </p>
<ul>
<li> <a target="_blank">Putkey with all IPs</a>
</li>
<li> <a target="_blank">Forcing the nodename IP</a>
</li>
<li> <a target="_blank">Touching all putkey-related files</a>
</li>
<li> <a target="_blank">Flushing all putkey-related files</a>
</li>
<li> <a target="_blank">If you don't want to fwstop the firewall module</a>
</li>
<li> <a target="_blank">As A Last Resort</a>
</li>
</ul>
<h3> <a target="_blank"></a>Putkey with all IPs</h3>
<p> A trick I have found that works is to use all possible IP addresses in<br />
 a<br />
putkey command. For example, if my management console had only one IP<br />
 (172.31.0.42)<br />
and my firewall had several IPs:</p>
<p><tt>le0: 153.1.214.10</tt> <br /><tt>qe0: 192.168.0.10</tt> <br /><tt>qe1: 172.16.0.10</tt> <br /><tt>qe2: 10.0.0.10</tt> </p>
<p>My putkey from the management console to the firewall would look like</p>
<p>this:
 </p>
<p><tt>fw putkey 153.1.214.10 192.168.0.10 172.16.0.10 10.0.0.10</tt> </p>
<p>And my putkey from the firewall to the management console would be:
 </p>
<p><tt>fw putkey 172.31.0.42</tt> </p>
<p>In a step-by-step manner, here is what you would do:
 </p>
<ol>
<li> fwstop both the management and firewall modules</li>
<p>    </p>
<li> On the FireWall, type: <tt>fw putkey 172.31.0.42</tt>
</li>
<p>    </p>
<li> On the management console, type: <tt>fw putkey 153.1.214.10 192.168.0.10
<p>172.16.0.10 10.0.0.10</tt>
</li>
<p>
<li> fwstart the management console</li>
<p>    </p>
<li> fwstart the firewall module</li>
</ol>
<h3> <a target="_blank"></a>Forcing the nodename IP</h3>
<p> When performing the authentication necessary for remote management, FireWall-1</p>
<p>will attempt to use the 'nodename IP' to communicate between the systems.</p>
<p>If the nodename IP does not exist or is not reachable from all systems,<br />
 this<br />
causes putkeys to not work. A way to get around this problem is to<br />
 use putkey<br />
in the following manner:</p>
<p><tt>fw putkey -n local-ip remote-ip</tt> </p>
<p>The "local ip" here depends on which interface you will need to talk<br />
 out<br />
to see the remote system. The "remote ip" will be the IP address that<br />
 is<br />
closest to you.
 </p>
<p>For instance, if your firewall had the following interfaces:
 </p>
<p><tt>le0: 153.1.214.10</tt> <br /><tt>qe0: 192.168.0.10</tt> <br /><tt>qe1: 172.16.0.10</tt> <br /><tt>qe2: 10.0.0.10</tt> </p>
<p>And your management console had the following interfaces:
 </p>
<p><tt>le0: 172.16.10.42</tt> </p>
<p>On the firewall console, you would type:
 </p>
<p><tt>fw putkey -n 172.16.0.10 172.16.10.42</tt> </p>
<p>On the management console, you would type:
 </p>
<p><tt>fw putkey -n 172.16.10.42 172.16.0.10</tt> </p>
<p>In a step-by-step manner, here is what you would do:
 </p>
<ol>
<li> fwstop both the management and firewall modules</li>
<li> On the FireWall, type: <tt>fw putkey -n 172.16.0.10 172.16.10.42</tt>
</li>
<li> On the management console, type: <tt>fw putkey -n 172.16.10.42 172.16.0.10</tt>
</li>
<li> fwstart the management console</li>
<li> fwstart the firewall module</li>
</ol>
<h3> <a target="_blank"></a>Touching all putkey-related files</h3>
<p> <a target="_blank" href="mailto:karimi@ca.ibm.com">Karim Ismail</a> makes the following</p>
<p>suggestion: Simply "touch" the following files (i.e. use the Unix/IPSO<br />
 "touch"<br />
command) before performing the putkey command:</p>
<p>$FWDIR/conf/fwauth.keys<br />
 <br />
$FWDIR/conf/serverkeys.*<br />
 <br />
$FWDIR/database/authkeys.C<br />
 <br />
$FWDIR/database/opsec_authkeys.C
 </p>
<h3> <a target="_blank"></a>The control.map file</h3>
<p> Sometimes, you will need to add IP addresses to $FWDIR/lib/control.map<br />
 because,<br />
for whatever reason, FireWall-1 is not seeing the IP address it<br />
 is hearing<br />
the connection from as the appropriate type of host (either<br />
 as a remote<br />
firewall module or a management console). In any case, you<br />
 can insure that<br />
FireWall-1 is handling this correctly by editing $FWDIR/lib/control.map.</p>
<p>Add <b>all</b> the IPs of the remote hosts you wish to authenticate with</p>
<p>in a new line (above the MASTERS, CLIENT, and * lines) and force the authentication</p>
<p>that will be used for these IPs to the appropriate authentication scheme</p>
<p>(fwn1, fwa1, skey).</p>
<p><tt>a.b.c.d, e.f.g.h : */fwa1</tt> <br /><tt>MASTERS :stat,getkey,gettopo/none opsec/fwn1 */fwa1</tt> <br /><tt>CLIENT  :load,db_download,fetch,log/fwa1   opsec/fwn1</p>
<p>*/none</tt> <br /><tt>*       :stat,getkey,gettopo/none<br />
 unload,ioctl,load,db_download/deny<br />
opsec/fwn1 */fwa1</tt> </p>
<p>If you edit this file, stop and start FireWall-1. For more information <br />
on control.map, see: <a target="_blank">Failed to Install Security Policy<br />
on fw62bs01: Unauthorized action<br /></a></p>
<p><a target="_blank"></a> </p>
<h3> <a target="_blank"></a>Flushing All Putkey-Related Files</h3>
<p> There are some cases where even this does not work. Here is a procedure</p>
<p>developed by <a target="_blank" href="mailto:lance@spitzner.net">Lance Spitzner</a> (which</p>
<p>I have slightly modified):</p>
<p>On the Management Module
 </p>
<ul>
<li>  fwstop</li>
<li>  Backup the following files by copying them to &lt;filename&gt;.old</li>
<ul>
<li> $FWDIR/database/authkeys.C</li>
<li> $FWDIR/database/opsec_authkeys.C</li>
<li> $FWDIR/conf/fwauth.keys</li>
<li> $FWDIR/conf/serverkeys.*</li>
</ul>
<li> Remove the above files</li>
<li> Confirm that $FWDIR/lib/control.map is using the same authentication<br />
as<br />
 the remote modules (fwa1 or skey).</li>
<li> Make sure /etc/hosts has an entry for the remote module(s).</li>
</ul>
<p> On the Remote Module</p>
<ul>
<li> fwstop</li>
<li> Backup the following files by copying them to &lt;filename&gt;.old</li>
<ul>
<li> $FWDIR/database/authkeys.C</li>
<li> $FWDIR/database/opsec_authkeys.C</li>
<li> $FWDIR/conf/fwauth.keys</li>
<li> $FWDIR/conf/serverkeys.*</li>
</ul>
<li> Remove the above files</li>
<li> Confirm that $FWDIR/lib/control.map is using the same authentication<br />
as<br />
 the management module (fwa1 or skey).</li>
<li> Make sure /etc/hosts has an entry for the management module.</li>
</ul>
<p> On the Management Module: fw putkey -p &lt;password&gt; -n &lt;local IP&gt;<br />
&lt;remote<br />
 IP&gt;</p>
<p>On the Remote Module: fw putkey -p &lt;password&gt; -n &lt;local IP&gt;<br />
&lt;remote<br />
 IP&gt;
 </p>
<p>On the Mangement Module: fwstart
 </p>
<p>On the Remote Module: fwstart
 </p>
<p>That's it!  If that did not do the trick, ensure all Network Objects</p>
<p>in Rule Base match /etc/hosts file and fw putkey IP addresses.  Repeat</p>
<p>steps above.
 </p>
<h3> <a target="_blank"></a>If you don't want to fwstop the firewall modules</h3>
<p> I personally have had success sometimes simply killing and restarting fwd,</p>
<p>which is not as drastic as restarting FireWall-1, but can make certain<br />
 services<br />
unavailable. However, <a target="_blank" href="mailto:bfilmer@ims.telstra.com.au" title="Link: mailto:bfilmer@ims.telstra.com.au">Bradley</p>
<p>Filmer</a> says this method does not require fwstopping the firewall module.</p>
<p>On the firewall module, edit $FWDIR/database/authkeys.C and remove everything</p>
<p>between the opening parenthesis "(" and the closing parenthesis ")". Redo</p>
<p>the putkeys using one of the methods above (he suggests using the -n method,</p>
<p>but only use that method if you have to). On the management console, do<br />
 the<br />
same thing except perform an fwstop and fwstart afterwords.
 </p>
<h3> <a target="_blank"></a>As a Last Resort</h3>
<p> Sometimes, you will need to reboot either the management console, firewall</p>
<p>module, or both to make putkeys work. Don't necessarily have an explanation</p>
<p>for it. If you reboot one but not the other, execute an fwstop; fwstart<br />
 on<br />
the other box.</p>
<p>Even after that, it may not work either. What you can do is disable<br />
 putkey<br />
authentication entirely. Note that this is not entirely recommended<br />
 in all<br />
cases, but if you need to get it working quickly, this trick will<br />
 definately<br />
work. Edit control.map as above on all involved systems and<br />
 use "none" as<br />
the authentication scheme. Stop and start FireWall-1. You<br />
 will no longer<br />
have any more troubles with putkeys between these systems<br />
 as you have effectively<br />
reduced the authentication to IP only.
