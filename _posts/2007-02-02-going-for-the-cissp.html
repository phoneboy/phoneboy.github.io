<p>A <a target="_blank" href="http://www.disruptivetelephony.com/2007/02/in_the_service_.html">blog posting</a> from Dan York reminded me that I need to sign up for my CISSP class so that I can go for that lovely CISSP certification in the first half. His post clearly highlighted some of the issues one must go through to not only get, but <em>maintain</em> the certification. All of those hoops are what sets the CISSP apart from other certifications.</p>
<p>My career in the computer security industry goes back to my first job out of school where I worked at a recruiting firm and was their system administrator. We also began to sell TIS Gauntlet, did an install, and learned the ropes. Through that company, I found a job working for a Check Point reseller and I began to support FireWall-1. A website dedicated to FireWall-1 and two books later, I got knee deep in security.</p>
<p>Even though I don't directly support FireWall-1 these days (now it's called VPN-1 Pro--Check Point always did like renaming their product every couple of years), I work with some other security products. One of the things I do as part of my job is analyze either customer-reported or internally-reported security issues and determine what, if anything, needs to be done about it. I play a large role in writing and publishing the actual customer advisory.</p>
