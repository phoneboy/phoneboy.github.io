<p>Several years ago, I purchased a domain for our family. Upon doing the prerequisite search, we ultimately settled on a .net name. Not our first choice, but it was what was available.</p>
<p>On 1 January, I got an email from a company called Zip Domains on my admin email address:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our company specializes in acquiring expired domain names to help individuals and businesses protect their brand online.</p>
<p>The domain name XXXXXX.COM is expired and will become available soon.</p>
<p>We noticed that you own XXXXXX.NET and felt that you may be interested in acquiring the .COM version of your existing domain name.</p>
<p>We can assist in trying to acquire the domain name, as there are likely many interested parties competing for it.</p>
<p>There are no upfront costs, and the fee if we are successful is only $199 USD.</p>
<p>If you are interested, please let us know by January 3 at the latest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, but someone tried to sell me the domain earlier in the year for less than that. Think I'm going to pay $199 to some company that spammed me? Fat chance!</p>
<p>At that point, I checked the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS">whois</a> registry and found the domain was about to be removed from DNS, just like they said. I figured, I'll wait a few days for it to be removed from the whois registry and try to purchase it through 1&amp;1.</p>
<p>On the 9th, I got another email from Zip Domains telling me they had secured the rights to the domain and I could purchase it from them for only $99!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our company specializes in acquiring expired domain names to help individuals and businesses protect their brand online.</p>
<p>The domain name XXXXXX.COM expired recently and we were able to secure it.</p>
<p>We noticed the you own XXXXXX.COM and felt that you may be interested in acquiring the .COM version of your existing domain name.</p>
<p>It is available for a one-time fee of only $99.00 USD.</p>
<p>To purchase or learn more, please visit http://zipdomains.com/buy.php?domain=xxxxxx.com</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the domain was still showing as being deleted in whois, when I checked the next day, it was available. I went into my domain control panel on 1&amp;1 and ordered the .com domain for $8.99, saving me over 1000% what Zip Domains wanted to charge!</p>
<p>I thank Zip Domains for making me aware of the expired domain. However, there was zero chance I was going to pay above the typical registration cost for a domain, particularly for my family where the value of having "the right" domain is relatively low.</p>
<p>I have to wonder how many people fall for zipdomains "scam," buying a domain they could have had for the nominal cost if they waited a few days. It's not clear to me ZipDomains actually <em>does</em> anything to secure a domain name. The domain was either marked as "being deleted" or "not present" in whois when Zip Domains told me they had secured it for my purchase, so I question their legitimacy. (If someone from Zip Domains wants to rebut my statements, leave a comment below)</p>
<p>In short, beware of companies that are trying to scare you into buying a domain from them or send you "renewal" notices in the postal mail--that's my favorite one.</p>
