For those of you who don't know, I produce a short but regular podcast called [PhoneBoy Speaks](https://phoneboy.com/ps). It is not exclusively information security focused, though I do maintain a [RSS feed for infosec-related episodes](http://media.phoneboy.com/ps-infosec.xml) if that's all your interested in.

On the last couple episodes, I discussed the FBI's requests to Apple to assist them in breaking into a specific iPhone "because terrorism," which I covered in written form already. I don't think I say anything different in these podcasts, but if you like audio better than reading, here you go:

* [PhoneBoy Speaks Ep 1070: It's Not Just About One iPhone](https://phoneboy.com/ps/1070)
* [PhoneBoy Speaks Ep 1071: What's On Farook's iPhone, Anyway?](https://phoneboy.com/ps/1071)

**Disclaimer**: I haven't asked what my employer [Check Point Software Technologies](https://www.checkpoint.com) thinks about all this. These thoughts are my own.
