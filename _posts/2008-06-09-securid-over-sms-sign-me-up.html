<p>As someone who spends an inordinate amount of time working from home, I always have to know where my SecurID token is. Without it and the six digits it provides, I will pound sand trying to get into the corporate network.</p>
<p>But the SecurID token is lame. Sure, it comes in a number of form factors, but I'd rather not mess with it at all. That being said, as a security person, I think it is a necessary evil.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.smstextnews.com/2008/04/leave_your_securid_key_at_home_just_text_with_clickatell.html" title="Link: http://www.smstextnews.com/2008/04/leave_your_securid_key_at_home_just_text_with_clickatell.html">I was excited when I initially read this article on SMS Text News</a> about using SecurID with something I also need to know where is at all times--my mobile phone! <a target="_blank" href="http://www.clickatell.com/" title="Link: http://www.clickatell.com/">Clickatell</a> offers a service that sends those 6 digit codes over SMS to your mobile phone when you need to authenticate some place requiring strong authentication. You then provide that number--along with your PIN--to the remote server.</p>
<p>I like this solution because it requiers no software to be installed on the phone. It can be problematic when your provider has delays with SMS--happens more often than I care to think about, actually. That being said, it appeals to me greatly.</p>
