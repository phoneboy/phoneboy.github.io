<p>A couple of people I know got signed up for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.quechup.com/" title="Link: http://www.quechup.com/">Quechup</a>. My address was apparently "harvested" from the address book of these folks and I've been invited--multiple times, even--to join this service.</p>
<p>I've looked through this service and I see absolutely no reason to join this place. It looks like a lame me-too service with no obvious value. The fact they want an address book is very irritating. Given the relative intelligence on the Internet with regard to these matters, I suspect I will see a lot of spam related to Quechup. <a target="_blank" href="http://ipadventures.com/2007/09/06/quechup-rat-bastard-disease-of-the-internet/" title="Link: http://ipadventures.com/2007/09/06/quechup-rat-bastard-disease-of-the-internet/">Even people who <em>do</em> know better occasionally get sucked in</a>.</p>
<p>Bottom line: avoid these twits like the plague.</p>
