<p>Today I got word that I passed my <a target="_blank" href="https://www.isc2.org/cgi-bin/content.cgi?category=97">CISSP</a> exam. The next phase in the process is getting endorsed by another CISSP. Currently, they also permit being endorsed by holders of other, related credentials, though on 1 October 2007, that will no longer be allowed. Since I'm in the Nokia office this week and one of my co-workers is a CISSP, getting him to fill out the endorsement form and email it along with my resume back to ISC2 was not a big deal.</p>
<p>In theory, I should be a CISSP in the next few weeks.</p>
