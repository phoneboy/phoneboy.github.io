I decided that I'm going to let the phoneboy.net URL expire when it comes up for renewal in a couple of months. As a result of that, the URL for this blog (such that it is) will change to http://securitytheater.phoneboy.com

(*Edit*: Now it's http://phoneboy.org, but the securitytheater URLs will redirect)

Please update your RSS readers, bookmarks, and the like.
