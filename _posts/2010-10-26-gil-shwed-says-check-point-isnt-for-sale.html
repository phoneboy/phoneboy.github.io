<p>FromÂ <a target="_blank" href="http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/check-point-isn-t-for-sale-says-shwed-1.320350?localLinksEnabled=false">Check Point isn't for sale, says Shwed - Haaretz Daily Newspaper | Israel News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two months ago, antivirus systems giant McAfee was sold to Intel for $7.7 billion. At the time, a number of analysts suggested that Check Point Software Technologies would also be an attractive target for takeover. Gil Shwed, the company's founder and leader, yesterday shrugged at the idea in conversation with reporters, after the company filed its third-quarter financials.</p>
<p>Anything's possible, Shwed said: but he's been very consistent in his position for the last 17 years, which is that Check Point isn't for sale. "We are very proud of the fact that we are an Israeli company, an independent one," he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would Check Point put themselves up for sale when the financials continue to be strong and only getting better? I think it's just "wishful thinking" by the analysis.</p>
