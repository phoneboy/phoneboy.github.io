<p>You want to know what I do at Nokia? Support platforms like these guys. Firewalls, intrusion detection, VPNs. Yup, that's what I do.</p>
<p>Today, our little corner of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nokia.com/A4136001?newsid=1207497" title="Link: http://www.nokia.com/A4136001?newsid=1207497">Nokia officially announces the availability of the Nokia IP2450 geared specifically at the IDS market</a>. <a target="_blank" href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4484506" title="Link: http://europe.nokia.com/A4484506">The Nokia IP2450 has been available as a firewall platform</a> for the past several months. Not a new platform, therefore, but new for the IDS market.</p>
<p>This 2U badboy will push 4 gigabits of data in a passive or inline mode and is expandable to 24 copper or fiber gigabit Ethernet ports. This means the box can sit inline on 11 different segments or monitor 23 segments passively. And yes, you can mix and match inline and passive mode ports.</p>
<p>The IDS on these boxes is provided by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sourcefire.com/">Sourcefire</a>, which are the folks behind the popular open-source <a target="_blank" href="http://www.snort.org/">snort</a> IDS tool. It runs on Nokia's Linux-based IPSO-LX OS. And, of course, it's backed by Nokia's worldwide technical support organization, of which I am a part of.</p>
<p>Don't ask me what these badboy's cost. I work in support, not sales. ;) Seriously, if you're interested, <a target="_blank" href="http://forms.nokiaforbusiness.com/?elqPURLPage=178" title="Link: http://forms.nokiaforbusiness.com/?elqPURLPage=178">Contact Nokia</a> or a <a target="_blank" href="http://nokia.infonow.net/partnerlocator/ShowSearchPage.do;jsessionid=06B0FF66960376CA74FFCA777DBDEF9E.webl7" title="Link: http://nokia.infonow.net/partnerlocator/ShowSearchPage.do;jsessionid=06B0FF66960376CA74FFCA777DBDEF9E.webl7">Nokia partner</a> for more details.</p>
