After a couple months of mostly being at home (nice change of pace), I'm
now taking the [Check Point CheckMates](https://community.checkpoint.com)
community on the road!

Aside from building the community site, where we've definitely seen an
uptick in activity in recent weeks, part of my charter is to faciliate
in-person Check Point meetups. We are starting these [in a number of
locations](https://community.checkpoint.com/community/checkmates-live)!
Four in particular I'd like to draw your attention to are ones I will
be at!

Sadly, I didn't get the bright idea to do this before last week,
where I was in Cincinnati. However, it's not too late to see me
in the following places over the next few weeks:

* [St. Louis: Join us to find out about CheckMates and R80.10!](https://community.checkpoint.com/events/1034-join-us-in-st-louis-to-find-out-about-checkmates-and-r8010)
* [London: Leveraging the R80.10 API to Automate and Streamline Security Operations](https://community.checkpoint.com/events/1036-london-leveraging-the-r8010-api-to-automate-and-streamline-security-operations)
* [Ireland: Live Upgrade of Check Point R77.30 to R80.10](https://community.checkpoint.com/events/1037-ireland-live-upgrade-of-check-point-r7730-to-r8010)
* [Seattle: Join us at Naked City Brewing!](https://community.checkpoint.com/events/1031-checkmates-event-at-naked-city-brewing)

Also, while I have your attention, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out the
Ask Me Anything we're doing with [Dr. Dorit Dor and her management team](https://community.checkpoint.com/events/1033-ask-me-anything-dr-dorit-dor-and-team)
on the 18th of September. Get your questions in now!
