<p>I've heard of companies outsourcing jobs to China. I used to joke with my remote co-workers that I had been replaced by a Perl script. That said,Â <a target="_blank" href="http://thenextweb.com/shareables/2013/01/16/verizon-finds-developer-outsourced-his-work-to-china-so-he-could-surf-reddit-and-watch-cat-videos/" title="Link: http://thenextweb.com/shareables/2013/01/16/verizon-finds-developer-outsourced-his-work-to-china-so-he-could-surf-reddit-and-watch-cat-videos/">I never heard of an employee outsourcing his own job</a>, going so far as to FedEx his RSA token to China so they could log into the VPN and do work on his behalf. While the real guy was in the office, working!</p>
<p>Regardless of what security or remote access solution you use, if you're not looking at your logs, you have no idea if you have a problem! That's how "Bob" was able to get away with this for months! No one bothered to look at the VPN logs and notice there was a remote access VPN connection going from China during the workday!</p>
<p>Of course, with the sheer volume of logs that your different security or remote access devices generate, it's hard to know what to look for. This is why large companies in particular employ Security Information Event Management systems (SIEMs) which attempt to gather and correlate this data from disparate systems to try and help you find that problem needle in the haystack of security logs--finding the key events that you need to focus on.</p>
<p>Check Point puts out a SIEM for its own product suite called SmartEvent, which works across all of our Software Blades and distills the hundreds of thousands of logs into useful and actionable data, telling you the things you need to know about what's going on through your ChecK Point infrastructure.</p>
<p>Regardless of whose security or remote access solutions you employ, if you're not looking at your logs, you have no idea what's going on!</p>
