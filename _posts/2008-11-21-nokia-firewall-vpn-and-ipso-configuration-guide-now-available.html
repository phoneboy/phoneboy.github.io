<p>Andrew Hay and Warren Verbanec, two of my former co-workers, along with Peter Giannoulis and Keli Hay have come together to make the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1597492868?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=phoneboycom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1597492868" title="Link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1597492868?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=phoneboycom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1597492868">Nokia Firewall, VPN, and IPSO Configuration Guide</a><img width="1" alt="" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ir?t=phoneboycom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=1597492868" height="1" />. These folks have put together a comprehensive tome covering all of Nokia's network security solutions, though the primary focus is on Nokia IPSO and Check Point VPN-1. I also played a small role in this book by writing the foreward for it, as well as helping both Andrew and Warren with various things over the years.</p>
<p>Of course, since the time this book was finished, but before it was printed and bound, and available on amazom.com and other places, <a target="_blank" href="http://phoneboy.com/2583/nokia-spinning-off-security-appliance-division" title="Link: http://phoneboy.com/2583/nokia-spinning-off-security-appliance-division">Nokia announced it was selling off the Security Appliance business</a>. Even if the boxes have a different name on them, which must happen eventually as result of new ownership, they'll still be the same high-quality systems you've come to know and love from Nokia.</p>
