<p>Anyone who's following the <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/checkpointsw">Check Point Twitter</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/checkpointsoftware">Facebook page</a>, or has been peeking around in User Center has probably seen the release of <a target="_blank" href="https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal?eventSubmit_doGoviewsolutiondetails=&amp;solutionid=sk58362">R75</a>--Check Point's next major release. DLP, Mobile Access, Identity Awareness, and Application Control are all now available as Software Blades--modules that can be enabled as needed.</p>
<p>Over the past several months, as part of my normal duties at Check Point, I have talked with a number of the people involved in this release. I've learned about some of the technologies that went into this release, and I have to say, it's quite amazing how it all comes together!</p>

Even if you don't immediately use the new features, there are some usability enhancements in the SmartConsole applications, an improved IPS engine, and, of course, <a target="_blank" href="http://appwiki.checkpoint.com/">AppWiki</a>, which is a great resource to find out about applications--even if you're not using our Application Control Software Blade!</p>
