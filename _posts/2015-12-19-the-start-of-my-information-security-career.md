I'm feeling a bit nostalgic recently as I realized it's been 20 years since I entered what we now call the Information Security industry. In the early to mid 1990s, I don't necessarily know if this term existed, but viewing it through a current lens, I think it's safe to say that's when I entered.

Of course, if you count the couple of years of system administration I did while I was in college, I started sooner. Back then there was just the guys who ran the servers. They had to do it all, including security. Of course, in those days, particularly in academia, everything was wide open to the Internet. Then again, no one outside of academia and a few large companies even had Internet access and most people didn't even know about it. 

Regardless, in the fall of 1995, I was beginning my post-college career doing what I spent a couple years doing in college: administering various Unix and Windows systems. The company I worked for had in-house contractors they hired out to other firms. They also matched job candidates with jobs (i.e. recruiters). They eventually contracted me out as well.  

My first exposure to proper hacking came in the form of a packet captures  another engineer at this company had captured of a system break-in in progress and had managed to render in a way that replayed the session as if you were watching over the hacker's shoulder while they were breaking into the system. Our company had a booth at the USENIX Conference in Monterey, CA and had intended to have it play in the background. As I was working the booth that day, and I was bored or inspired, I decided to narrate this break-in. It got a reasonable amount of attention. 

I'll be honest, I'm not sure where in this process I was exposed to a network firewall. It's been 20 years and I don't remember the exact chronology. The one thing I do know is that the first firewall I spent any serious time with was TIS Gauntlet. 

The funny thing about Gauntlet, back in those days, was that even though it was a commercial product, you had to compile it yourself to install it. The logic behind this was sound: you should know the code that is protecting you. That said, even back in those days, the code that made up the handful of proxies that made up the TIS Gauntlet product was pretty complex. However, it made for some interesting installation failures. Also, the thought of having a compiler on your firewall probably made some people squeamish. 

I also played with some other products: FWTK (or TIS Toolkit) in my home, DEC SEAL, and even ACLs on a Cisco router. But it was a fateful conversation from my boss at that time that ended up sending me towards Check Point FireWall-1: "how would you like to do tech support?"

At that point, I had no desire to do tech support. Even back then, tech support had a bad rap. Then again, as a sysadmin in a small company, I was often doing in-person tech support anyway. I decided to give it a try, even though I wasn't sure I'd like it.

The company he sent me to contract: Qualix Group. There were two products I had to support there: Qualix HA, a server product that allowed you to run an application across multiple servers in a "highly available" fashion, and Check Point FireWall-1, which could also be used with Qualix HA. (Check Point did not have ClusterXL back in those days)

I ended up loving it, and the rest is history. I ended up doing it for more than a dozen years for three different companies,  learning quite a bit about Check Point FireWall-1 and Information Security in the process. I'm glad I'm not doing that job today, but it was a great stepping stone to where I am today.

The bottom line: Don't be afraid to try something new and outside your comfort zone. This attitude has always served me well, not only in the very beginning of my career, but throughout. No matter how it turns out, you learn something in the process that will help you take the next step in whatever direction you want to go.

Another important point: if you want to get a start in information security, work on a helpdesk or in a technical assistance center. The amount of basic, practical knowledge you'll pick up is substantial and will help you decide exactly where in the industry where you want to focus your career.
