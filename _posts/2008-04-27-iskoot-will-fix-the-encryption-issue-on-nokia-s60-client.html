<p>Looks like iSkoot made a mistake with their Nokia S60 client and will make it right. Apparently a non-production version of the S60 client made it to the public web, which sends data in the clear. Other published versions of their client on other platforms are unaffected.</p>
<p>iSkoot CEO Mark Jacobstein says the existing S60 build will be pulled. The bug will be fixed and a forced upgrade to a patched version will be pushed.</p>
<p>Thanks to Andy Abramson and Jim Courtney for their behind-the-scenes help with this.Â <strong>Update</strong>: Forgot to thank Dan York as well, who helped despite spending the weekend driving a U-Haul. :)</p>
