<p>I got an email from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nsf.gov/" title="Link: http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</a> regarding an interesting technology they used to watch all the surveillance cameras at President Obama's inauguration. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?org=NSF&amp;cntn_id=114128&amp;preview=false" title="Link: http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?org=NSF&amp;cntn_id=114128&amp;preview=false">According to the press release put out by the NSF</a>, the technology created by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vsee.com/">VSee</a> allowed law enforcement the ability to look at multiple cameras in real-time--even from police cruisers on a mobile phone network connection!</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.vsee.com/site/page/purchase.html">VSee sells their technology</a> as a videoconferencing/application sharing service for companies, though at $50 per user per month, it's a bit pricey. However, you can be assured the service will work over low-bandwidth connections, is secured with FIPS 140-2 certified 256-bit AES encryption, and will traverse firewalls.</p>
<p>You can try the service with 3 users for free to see how well it works. Of course, without a Mac version, it's unlikely I'll spend a lot of time using it. I will have to see how well it works across the great firewall of Nokia before I become an ex-employee ;)</p>
