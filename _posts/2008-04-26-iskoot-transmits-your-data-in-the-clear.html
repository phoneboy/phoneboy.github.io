<p>Various people are thinking that <a target="_blank" href="http://mobiledownload.skype.com/">Skype Mobile</a> is basically an unbranded <a target="_blank" href="http://www.iskoot.com/">iSkoot</a>, which does the same thing in much the same way. Generally speaking, they seem to do the same thing, but they do it very differently. Packet traces don't lie.</p>
<p>I loaded up iSkoot on my <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N95">Nokia N95</a> and accessed the iSkoot service via WiFi. I did this so I could capture what the iSkoot client was sending out so I could see the difference. And oh, boy was it different--different enough that I would think twice about using iSkoot.</p>
<p>First of all, <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype">Skype</a> appeared to use a TCP connection on a non-standard port. Fine with me. I looked at the raw packets generated by Skype Mobile and saw an opaque blob--exactly what I expected to see.</p>
<p>iSkoot uses <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP port</a> 80--the same port used by HTTP, the lingua franca of downloading web pages. It sends various things as a series of HTTP GET calls. The scary part of this that your text chat messages--and lots of other interesting information, <strong><em>including your Skype credentials</em></strong>--is being transmitted <strong><em>in the clear</em></strong>. That's right, iSkoot takes all that perfectly good <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption">encryption</a> that Skype employs and throws it out the window. For no good reason.</p>
<p>Until iSkoot fixes this problem--and it would be <em>very</em> easy for them to do so (ever hear of SSL?)--I cannot in good conscious recommend using iSkoot.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://phoneboysecurity.posthaven.com/iskoot-for-s60-upgraded-obscured-by-ssl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Issue is resolved in their latest Symbian/S60 client</a>.</p>
