While it's not always a focus area of my [PhoneBoy Speaks](https://phoneboy.com/ps/) podcast, I do occasionally cover Information Security topics on my podcast. It happens often enough that I decided to create a dedicated RSS feed just for these topics: https://phoneboy.com/ps/infosec.xml

If you subscribe to the regular PhoneBoy Speaks feed, you don't need to subscribe to this one as this is merely a subset of the episodes that appear on my regular feed. This is only for people who are interested only in the Information Security topics I cover and not some of the other stuff I prattle on about.
