<p>When I was in Israel at the end of 2012, I was talking with the folks putting the finishing touches on the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.checkpoint.com/campaigns/security-report/">Check Point 2013 Security Report</a>. Of course, since then, the report has been formally released and you can now read it for yourself. Here's a video preview of what you'll find in it:</p>

<p>Some of the data gathered for this report was related to the 3D Security Reports Check Point generated for customers during 2012 where we took a Security Gateway and either ran it in-line (in bridge mode) or plugged it into a mirror port on a customer's switch. It's worth pointing out that, in many cases, <em>a competitive security solution was already in place</em> and the Check Point Security Gateways were seeing stuff the other solutions were missing.</p>
<p>Other data for this report also came from SensorNet, ThreatCloud, and results from our <a target="_blank" href="http://supportcontent.checkpoint.com/file_download?id=23302">Endpoint Security Best Practices Report</a>, which is a great way to find out if your Windows PC is configured according to our Best Practices.</p>
<p>The most surprising statistics?</p>
<ul>
<li>63% of the organizations surveyed had at least one malicious bot in their network. </li>
<li>43% of the organizations surveyed had traffic to/from an anonymizer service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, if you're knee deep in the security space, 0% of this is news to you.</p>
