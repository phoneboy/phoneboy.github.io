<p>Everyone blew <a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/RDM.Tech.Q2.07/FDA1E38F-4702-46B6-8ADE-D93BFA442BED.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">this supposed "Mac" security issue</a> out of the water, it seems. The Mac was "hacked," but it wasn't exactly specific to the Mac as the issue could be replicated in any browser on any system. It was a <em>local</em> exploit, at best, and it involved cross-site scripting, something that is inherently dangerous on <em>all</em> computers.</p>
<p>Please let me know when the Mac can be remotely rooted, though. <em>That</em> will be some serious news.</p>
