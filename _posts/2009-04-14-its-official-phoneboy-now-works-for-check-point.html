<p>Now that we have <a target="_blank" href="http://www.checkpoint.com/press/2009/check-point-completes-nokia-acquisition-041309.html">the official announcement</a>, I can now say I work for Check Point Software. And while I’ve been working <em>with</em> Check Point in some capacity or another since 1996, this is the first time I will actually be on their payroll.</p>
<p>A question I’ve gotten a bit since this was originally announced back in December is: what’s gonna happen to Nokia’s awesome support team? The good news is that the vast majority of that support team will be incorporated into Check Point. Furthermore, the combined support organization will implement best practices from both companies. In fact, Check Point’s support offerings now look very similar to those we sold at Nokia.</p>
<p>What about me? At the moment, I am trying to get through all the structural changes, which are still underway. I’m less worried about the “job” part of my job and more worried about more basic issues, like getting connected to Check Point’s Intranet, getting signed up for payroll and benefits, and understanding all the various policies and procedures–all of which will be different. So will my actual job, and I’ll begin to understand the particulars of it soon enough.</p>
